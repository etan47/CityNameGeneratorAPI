# CityNameGeneratorAPI
FastAPI for a transformer model that autogenerates American city names. <br />
Transformer model was trained using a kaggle database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/us-census-city-and-place-names <br />
Credit to Andrej Karpathy for his excellent video series on language models. <br />
